      "20 days",
      "25 days",
      "30 days"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient can take 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours, which means they could take up to 24 hours / 4 hours = 6 doses per day, or 2 puffs * 6 doses = 12 puffs per day. With 200 inhalations, the day's supply is 200 / 12 = 16.67 days. The closest answer is 16 days. The patient could also take a minimum of 24 hours / 6 hours = 4 doses per day, which would be 8 puffs per day. 200 / 8 = 25 days. Given the question is a bit ambiguous, the maximum is a safer answer. The question says '2 puffs q4-6h prn', so we must assume the worst case scenario of 12 puffs a day. Therefore, the answer should be 16 days. Let's re-examine the question. A 'prn' prescription means 'as needed'. This means we should use the minimum frequency to get the longest possible supply. The correct calculation should be: 200 inhalations / (2 puffs * (24 hours / 6 hours)) = 200 / (2*4) = 200 / 8 = 25 days."
