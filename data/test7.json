    "explanation": "A Category C medication error is an error that reached the patient but did not cause harm. In this case, the pharmacist caught the error before it reached the patient, which is a 'near miss' but is classified as a Category B error, which is an error that occurred but did not reach the patient. However, the provided answer is C. Let's re-read the question carefully. The question states that the pharmacist caught the error *before* it reached the patient. This would be a Category B error. The provided answer of 'Category C' is incorrect. A Category C error is an error that reached the patient but did not cause harm. An error that did not reach the patient is a Category B error. Let's assume there is a typo in the provided answer and that 'Category B' is the correct answer. Given the discrepancy, we will provide the correct answer based on the definition of the error categories."
