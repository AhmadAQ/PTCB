      "50 mL of 70%, 250 mL of 40%"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "This can be solved using the alligation method. Place the desired concentration (60%) in the middle. Put the two available concentrations (70% and 40%) on the left. Subtract diagonally: 70 - 60 = 10 parts of 70% solution, and 60 - 40 = 20 parts of 40% solution. The total parts are 10 + 20 = 30. The total volume is 300 mL. So, for the 70% solution, we need (10/30) * 300 mL = 100 mL. For the 40% solution, we need (20/30) * 300 mL = 200 mL. Wait, let me recheck my work.  (70-60)=10, (60-40)=20. Wait, I did it backwards. The first number should be on the top left. The second on the bottom left.  The answer should be 200mL of 70% and 100mL of 40%. The calculation is (20/(10+20)) * 300 = 200mL of 70% and (10/(10+20)) * 300 = 100mL of 40%. So the answer is (A) 200 mL of 70%, 100 mL of 40%."

Wait, let me recheck the options and question again. The answer should be 200 mg, but that's not an option. Let's re-calculate. 44 lbs is 20 kg. 20 kg * 10mg/kg = 200mg.  Hmm. The answer should be 200 mg but that's an option. Maybe the calculation is wrong.  Let's re-evaluate. The weight is 44 lb. The dose is 10 mg/kg.  Let's check the options again.  Wait, the options are 200mg, 220mg, 440mg, 968mg.  The closest is 200mg. It is possible the question is flawed.  However, based on the calculation, the answer should be 200mg.
