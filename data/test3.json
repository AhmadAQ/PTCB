    "options": [
      "96 mL",
      "192 mL",
      "720 mL",
      "1200 mL"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "First, convert the volumes and concentrations to a consistent unit. 1 pint is approximately 473 mL. The 5% solution is equivalent to 5 g/100 mL. The 1:50 solution is equivalent to 1 g/50 mL, or 2 g/100 mL, or a 2% solution. Using the formula C1V1 = C2V2: (5%)(473 mL) = (2%)(V2). Solving for V2 gives V2 = (5/2)*473 = 1182.5 mL. None of the options are correct. Let's re-examine the question. A pint is 480 mL. The 5% solution is 5 g/100 mL or 480 mL * 0.05 = 24 g of drug. The 1:50 solution is 1 g/50 mL or 0.02 g/mL. To find the volume of the 1:50 solution, we divide the total grams of drug by the new concentration: 24 g / (1 g/50 mL) = 24 g * 50 mL/g = 1200 mL. This is the volume of the new solution. Let's re-examine the alligation method: (C1) * V1 = (C2) * V2 where C1=5%, V1=1 pint=480 mL, C2 = (1/50) = 2%, and V2 is the unknown volume. (0.05) * 480 = (0.02) * V2. V2 = (0.05 * 480) / 0.02 = 1200 mL.  The question is asking how many mL of the 1:50 solution can be prepared *from* a 1 pint stock. So we have 1 pint of a 5% solution, which is 480mL. The amount of active ingredient is 0.05 * 480 = 24g. We want to prepare a 1:50 (1g/50mL) solution. The final volume would be 24g * 50mL/1g = 1200mL. Ah, the question is likely flawed or there is a misinterpretation.  Let's re-evaluate the previous calculation. It is possible there is a typo in the question and it should be 1 pint of a 10% solution instead of 5%. If it were a 10% solution, we would have 0.10 * 480 = 48g. The final volume would be 48g * 50mL/1g = 2400mL. Let's assume the question is asking to prepare 1200 mL from the stock solution. Let's go with the answer that is the closest to the calculation. The closest answer is 1200 mL. Let's reconsider another way of approaching this.  Using the provided options, let's see which one works. C1 * V1 = C2 * V2. 5% * 1 pint = (1/50) * V2. V2 = 5% * 1 pint / (1/50). A pint is 473 mL. V2 = 0.05 * 473 / 0.02 = 1182.5 mL. This is closest to 1200 mL. Let's reconsider the conversion of 1:50 w/v. This means 1 g of drug in 50 mL of solution. So we have a 2% solution. Our starting solution is 5% w/v. The total amount of drug is 1 pint (473 mL) * 5% = 23.65g. To make a 2% solution with 23.65g of drug, the total volume would be 23.65g / 0.02 = 1182.5 mL. The closest answer is **1200 mL**. The discrepancy is likely due to using 1 pint = 480 mL instead of 473 mL."
